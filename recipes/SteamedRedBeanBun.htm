            <p>The Steamed Red Bean Bun was sighted in the best-animated film of all time – Spirited Away. Chihiro, the
                protagonist, munched on a mega-sized red bean steamed bun as she gazed into the night. While it’s much
                easier to buy it from a supermarket, making this pastry from scratch can be pretty fun and satisfying.

            <ul>
                <li>1 cup of red beans</li>
                <li>5 cups of water</li>
                <li>3/4 cup of granulated sugar</li>
                <li>1 tbsp vanilla extract</li>
                <li>4 cups of flour</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon of granulated sugar</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon of instant yeast</li>
            </ul>

            <h3> <strong><u>STEPS: </u></strong> </h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Wash the red beans thoroughly before transferring into a cooker.</li>
                <li>Add in 3 cups of water and cook for 1 hour.</li>
                <li>Add sugar and vanilla extract into the rice cooker. Keep stirring until the water is fully absorbed
                    by the red beans. This might take up to 1 hour.</li>
                <li>Set aside and wait for it to cool down.</li>
                <li>Mix flour, 2 cups of lukewarm water, and yeast in an electric mixer until it forms a smooth dough.
                </li>
                <li>Knead for 10 minutes. </li>
                <li>Place the dough into a bowl and cover with cling wrap. Wait for an hour until the dough has risen to
                    twice of its original size.</li>
                <li>Add the cooled red bean compote into a blender. Blend until smooth.</li>
                <li>Add more flour on the surface of the dough and knead the dough into balls bigger than your palms.
                </li>
                <li>Flatten each ball and place some red bean paste into the middle of the dough. Slowly stretch and
                    seal the dough around the red bean paste.</li>
                <li>Leave the dough under a wet towel for 10 minutes.</li>
                <li>Add parchment paper into a steamer and place the buns inside. Steam for about 12 minutes.</li>
                <li>Turn off the heat for 1-2 minutes and the steamed buns are ready.</li>
            </ol>
